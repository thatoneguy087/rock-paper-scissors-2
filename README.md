# rock-paper-scissors-2
Basic rock-paper-scissors game with interactive UI elements, done as a
part of The Odin Project. 

You can find a live example [here](https://thatoneguy087.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-2/).

This is the second, much improved version from the [previous](https://github.com/thatoneguy087/top-rock-paper-scissors)
rock-paper-scissors game, only playable in the dev-tools console, and with *very* unreadable code.
